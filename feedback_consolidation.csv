Another parallelism format: Today, if a test suite contains 3 tests and 3 devices were added to the browserstack.yml file, 9 executions will be carried out, as the same test is executed on all devices. Here at Sicredi, until now we have been working with another parallelism format, where in the scenario I described, only 3 tests would be executed, that is, each test would only be executed once and on one device (without the need for a relationship between device x test scenario) .

The use case with Levi's is for eg: If they have 10 tests and need to execute all of them or max number of tests in parallel, they can set the parallelPerPlatform value to a desired number. However, the issue is if more than one platform are defined in the yml, the same tests are running multiple times on other devices. They need the test to run only once in a device. Currently I had suggested to use regular expression to specify device attributes but even in that case we are limited to adding a particular device model for this particular parallel execution. 

It is best if this type of granularity for parallel execution can be defined in the yml file.

The customer has a feature file with 5 Scenarios in it and what to run each of these scenarios on a unique device in parallel.

Customer wants to test two different apps as part of the same run (different sessions). With the hardcoded desired capabilities  approach, they are solving it by using two different Examples with different tags (one for app1 & other for app2) for the same scenario. In the capability, they are able to add the right app id using the data passed through the Cucumber example (Scenario outline). They wanted this use case to be supported by SDK. they are a Sauce labs customer & this is a 400K opportunity. Any help in expediting this request would be of great help. For now, I have recommended the legacy approach, however they prefer the SDK approach over the legacy approach.

Their app is an identification app which cans ID proofs like passport for completing different flows

KoTest is a widely popular testing framework for Kotlin developers, and supporting it would add great value to your services. Additionally, if you are at some point able to provide a public API to Test Observability, we could easily integrate with it as an alternative to the SDK.

The customer has a complex custom framework and multiple projects. They aim to use a single SDK configuration YAML file across all projects, where custom platforms and other capabilities will be passed at runtime.
Each project currently uses a separate driver instance, which aligns with legacy approach. Current setup is functioning smoothly, and adopting the SDK presents challenges due to the differences in approach.
The customer questioned the value of switching to the SDK when their existing approach meets their needs effectively. Despite pitching SDK adoption previously, the customer declined, citing no immediate need for change.
With the introduction of the new App Automate Observability Dashboard, the SDK was pitched again during the call. The goal is to encourage SDK adoption as a stepping stone to promoting other products in the future.
It is currently not feasible to have a single YML file shared across multiple projects with the SDK, which is a primary requirement for the customer.

Enforce Central Local Tunnel Settings,Bug,4,"The SDK initiates a new local tunnel instead of honoring existing, centrally-configured enterprise tunnel settings, undermining policy enforcement.",[],1,"Enterprise-Level Enforcement of Tunnel Settings in BrowserStack h3. Product Feedback Details

The customer is using Central local testing and when they are running automation using Browserstack SDK, another local tunnel is getting created instead of honouring the existing central local tunnel.The current implementation requires users to manually configure settings like skipBinaryInitialisation and local identifier flag to avoid bypassing enterprise-enforced settings. This approach is error-prone and undermines centralized management. Customers expect that enterprise-level settings, such as those configured in the Tunnel Settings section of the BrowserStack account portal, should take precedence over individual user configurations.

h3. Product Feedback Justification

This highlights an essential need for enterprise users: the ability to enforce organizational policies seamlessly across all test environments, without depending on individual users to configure settings correctly.

Slack Thread Analysis: The user, hrishikesh.b, inquired about the feasibility of generating a Test Management (TM) API key for a service account, specifically noting that service accounts lack a user interface for key generation. They sought confirmation on whether the standard `username:access-key` format, when applied to a service account (`<service_account_username>:<service_account_access_key>`), would function correctly without negative consequences. The response confirmed that the API key format is consistent across BrowserStack products and can be generated on the user's side, and that using a service account's credentials in this format is valid and safe.
